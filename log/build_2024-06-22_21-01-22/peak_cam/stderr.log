CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findids_peak.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ids_peak",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ids_peak" with any
  of the following names:

    ids_peakConfig.cmake
    ids_peak-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ids_peak" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ids_peak_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ids_peak" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
